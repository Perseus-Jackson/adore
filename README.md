# Automated Driving Open Research (ADORe)
Eclipse ADORe is a modular software library and toolkit for decision making, planning, control and simulation of automated vehicles. 
It is currently developed at DLR (German Aerospace Center), Institute of Transportation Systems.
Some things you will find here:
- Algorithms and data models applied in real automated driving system for motion planning and control
- Mechanisms for safe interaction with other CAVs, infrastructure, traffic management, interactions with human-driven vehicles, bicyclists, pedestrians
- Integration with typical tools and formats such as ROS, [SUMO](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo), CARLA, OpenDrive, Road2Simulation, ITS-G5 V2X (MAPEM, SPATEM, DENM, MCM, SREM)

Here you can see one of our automated test vehicles being operated by ADORe:
